                            We chose female artists as the theme this time, because we think in the modern society, the voices of female artists are still easily ignored, especially in the narrative of art history, women are often placed in a secondary position. However, their works often contain strong emotional power, and also can reflect the cultural background and social situation of their times. therefore, I decided to study Japanese female artist Yayoi Kusama. She is known as the "Queen of Waves", and she works has a unique style, and also deeply expresses her inner spiritual world. I have collected introductions about her life, artistic style analysis and some representative works in many websites and databases, and sorted them out and put them into my website content.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           In terms of design, I choose to present it on the web page because it is more intuitive and easier for viewers to understand the artist's story. Web pages can present text and images at the same time, making the content reading rhythm more natural. I use VS Code to write the HTML and CSS of the whole page, and I am responsible for conceiving the typesetting structure inside the Kusama page. In addition, the layout of the homepage of our group and the visual design of the overall website are my ideas and preliminary ideas in my mind, so that the whole website can present a more unified style.

                            In the implementation stage, my page successfully achieved the original goal: clear content, clean layout, and easy-to-read structure. Finally, Zhong Yi integrated the pages of all members through GitHub to form a complete website.

                            In the reflection part, I think the overall effect is good, but if there is a chance to improve in the future, I hope to add more interactive designs, such as dynamic effects or clickable work descriptions, so that the audience can have a richer experience when browsing, and make the whole digital artwork more vivid and interesting.

                            Our group focused on female artists, as their work and presence have often been overlooked in historical narratives. I chose Wenshu as the theme for my webpage because she represents the unique creative practice of literati women in the Ming dynasty. Restricted by feudal norms, women could not work publicly or travel, so their creative space was largely confined to the inner chambers. Their work was often undervalued at the time. Yet, I believe their delicate depictions of flowers, plants, insects, and birds reveal a distinctive artistic and spiritual world. Wenshu's paintings are not just visual expressions but a medium for women to carve out personal space, express themselves, and convey life reflections within limited confines. I also made the home page and reflection page.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For the Wenshu page, I used html, css and javascript, designed an interactive exhibition where viewers can click to preview her works and use the mouse to zoom and move, simulating a personal exploration of the paintings. I also added traditional Chinese music to enhance immersion. I used hotspot functionality to allow viewers to explore marked points on the painting with their mouse and extract information from them. I also added a guided exploration system to show viewers important symbols.Beyond this page, I created the artist homepage to gather all group members' pages. 

                            The website works well and achieved my goal of making the audience engage with Wenshu's artistic world. However, there is room for improvement, especially in the artist introduction section. Next time, I plan to use a first-person narrative and create an overall artist map to better illustrate her environment and artistic context.</p>

                           Louise Bourgeois' art is a raw, unfiltered conversation with the soul—her towering Maman spider embodies the duality of maternal protection and fear, while the Cells series cages the intangibility of trauma and memory. Her courage to excavate the darkest corners of human emotion turns personal pain into universal truth, proving art’s power to make the invisible visible. What resonates most is her late-career acclaim: her work outlasted time, a testament to the endurance of authentic emotional expression.

                            Building her website deepened my understanding of design as a narrative medium, not just a visual tool. Structuring content into "biography-style-works-influence" wasn’t just organizational—it mirrored Bourgeois’ own practice of weaving life into art, creating a logical flow that guides viewers through her emotional journey. Using purple (evoking her work’s mystique) and orange (its raw vitality) in Tailwind wasn’t mere aesthetics, but a visual translation of her complex tone. Subtle interactions like card hovers and smooth scrolling added gentle warmth without overshadowing her intense art, while balancing desktop richness with mobile clarity ensured her legacy is accessible to all. This process taught me that great web design, like Bourgeois’ art, lies in harmonizing form with the soul of the content—turning code into a bridge between the artist’s vision and the viewer’s connection.
